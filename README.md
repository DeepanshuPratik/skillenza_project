## Project Title
## TSRO ( Track Specifier and Route Optimizer )
## Problem Statement
### Crowdsourced Support Systems
#### Riders who deliver to our homes/ offices etc have a very difficult life. They spend hours on the road, battling traffic, rain, sun and come what may, they are at our doorstep in time! Can we make their life simpler? Can we build some crowdsourced local intelligence to help delivery partners to navigate their day better through real time, sharp local knowledge? There are around 4 million delivery people in India- imagine the power of the data that can be generated through this network.
## Requirements 
#### Can real time intelligence on traffic/roadblocks be generated, that beats Google?
#### Can a rider always know which are the best places to park?
#### Can a rider be aware of the expected wait time at a pick up point which can be a restaurant, a dark store or a kirana shop ?
#### Can intelligence be built around rain and shared real time with the rider network?
#### Can more accurate ETAs/ predictability of orders be shared with customers based on the above?
## Approach Towards Problem Statement
#### We plan to use data collected from delivery persons as feedback via app to aid others in selecting an optimal route. Data concerned would include certain parameters that are “sufficient and efficient” to develop an inference about the route that was taken by the delivery person. Furthermore, collected data would be fed to a ML algorithm to predict the optimality of a route in future. Factors like rain and wind would also be taken into consideration by integrating a weather API.
## Technologies Involved in Deployment
